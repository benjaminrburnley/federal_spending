The project will provide a significant portion of the sewer infrastructure needed to address the wastewater needs of the Centerville River Watershed. The project is identified in the Townâ  s Wastewater Plan.
 
 The project involves the installation of sewer infrastructure to accommodate future sewer expansion identified in the Town's wastewater plan. The scope of work will include the installation of gravity sewer along Route 28, a sewer force main in Yarmouth Road will connect the future â  Old Yarmouth Roadâ   sewer expansion to the existing collection system and multiple force mains within Route 28.
 
 Barnstable has 27 wastewater pump stations and many of them have equipment that is well over its useful life and requires replacement to prevent anticipated major failures and impacts to public health and the environment. Pump station improvement projects over the next 20 years were identified in the Asset Management Plan. Several factors contributed to the recommendations for improvements in year 1 including the end of service life (useful life) of equipment, coastal resiliency, and energy improvements/electrical upgrades.
 
 This project includes upgrades and modifications to the existing WPCF. These improvements include the addition of two gravity belt thickening units as well as the replacement of other aged systems that have exceeded their useful life.

This project will eliminate the Rosa Terrace and Sonne Avenue pump stations and replace the Wathen Lane and Sanders Lane pump stations. These are some of the most problematic pump stations in Jefferson County and all four are in low to moderate income areas. All of the pump stations are in the Dixie Highway area of Louisville adjacent to or just outside this significant commercial corridor. 
 
 The Rosa Terrace pump station will be eliminated with nearly 1,500 linear feet of eight-inch gravity sewer. Construction will occur in a residential/commercial area and will involve a railroad crossing. Some of the proposed sewer will be relatively deep which may require some more specialized construction techniques such as stacked trench-boxes or shoring, larger excavation equipment, and/or trench-less installation methods (jack-and-bore, micro-tunneling, etc.). Overall, the average depth of the sewer is approximately 17-feet. 
 
 Over 2,700 linear feet of eight-inch gravity sewer will be used to eliminate the Sonne Avenue Pump Station. In addition to having to cross a state road (Dixie Highway - 31W), portions of the sewer will be somewhat deep and in a residential area. Fortunately, there are numerous detour options and the impact to residents will be relatively minor. 
 
 To eliminate the Wathen Lane pump station rehabilitation project consists of a full replacement of the existing pump station. The existing pump station will be replaced with a new, modern station and will utilize the existing 6â   force main. As part of the layout of the proposed station, a dedicated entrance drive and concrete maintenance pad will be constructed to provide MSD staff with a safe and secure area to service the pump station in the future.
 
 The Sanders Lane pump station rehabilitation project consists of the replacement of approximately 450 linear feet of existing 4â   force main from the existing pump station. The new force main will follow the same general alignment of the existing. In addition to the force main replacement, there will be additional site improvements to the area immediately adjacent to the existing pump station. A dedicated entrance drive and concrete maintenance pad will be constructed to provide MSD staff with a safe and secure area to service the pump station in the future. This new concrete pad will also house a new emergency backup generator and the upgraded electrical components.
 
 Currently MSD serves over 220,000 residential and over 21,000 commercial and industrial customers.""",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_21000120_6800/,2021-07-27 15:17:49+00

All construction will occur on the 11.5 acre site owned by the Heard County Water Authority at 200 Waterworks Road.  The Water Treatment Facility is a 3.0 MGD surface water plant which uses a â  package plantâ   system to treat water going to the distribution system.  The original plant was built in 1988 (1.0 MGD) and a parallel plant expansion was added in 1993 (2.0 MGD).  The purpose of this project is to repair, replace, and rehabilitate numerous components of the treatment plant that are outdated or have reached the end of their useful service life.  The upgrade of two 0.5 mgd filter units to 1.0 mgd filter units will increase the capacity of the plant to 4.0 MGD. These improvements would include, but are not limited to the following:
 â ¢ Building and structural repairs to the exterior wall panels, interior wall panels, roofing system, HVAC system, and steel structural support system
 â ¢ Building and structural improvements to include an expansion of storage and lab square footage, and rehab of existing administration area
 â ¢ Process equipment improvements to include structural repairs and corrosion protection of the existing steel tankage, replacement of the tube settlers, replacement of the media in the adsorption clarifier and the filters, and replacement of the flocculation equipment

This will be determined from the test well data.
 
 The existing connection with Belmont will then be used as a backup supply in the event of a well failure.  The piping from Belmont is proposed to be routed to the new ground storage tank, so that when water from Belmont is used, it can be treated with both the proposed chlorination system and the proposed disinfection byproduct treatment system.  This will be required if Belmont is unable to achieve compliance with its own system.

 Comprehensive Habitat Management Program (CHMP) are the focus of 10 tasks in this application.
 CMP Water Quality Needs:
 I - Provide a technical basis for water quality improvement actions through monitoring, needs assessment, and research
 (Tasks 1, 2, 3);
 II - Reduce adverse impacts of urban runoff on Basin water quality (Task 3);
 III - Eliminate sewage-related pollution impacts on Basin water quality (Task 3);
 IV - Reduce impacts of industrial and commercially generated pollution on Basin water quality (Task 3).
 LPBF s Water Quality Program will perform monitoring and research activities concerning water quality (Task 1, 2), and
 reduce pollution from commercial wastewater treatment plants (Task 3).
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 CHMP Needs (with page numbers for reference within the CHMP):
   Science to divert Mississippi River flow in new areas (including Lower Basin 99-105): Task 4;
   Optimize habitat benefits of the Caernarvon Diversion (102, 104); Task 4;
   Monitor the reestablishment of the baseline conditions due to Mississippi Gulf Outlet closure (90-102): Tasks 4, 5, 6.
 LPBF s Coast and Community Program will gather, analyze, and map data to share with subscribing researchers and
 fishers, including salinity and hypoxia data (Tasks 4, 5), as well as turbidity data at a Mississippi River diversion (Task 4),
 and using Geographic Information System (GIS) software to map the data (Task 6).
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 CMP Education/Public Participation Needs:
 II-Increase availability of appropriate educational materials to all residents in the Basin (Tasks 7, 8);
 III-Promote grassroots public participation in Basin cleanup (Tasks 7, 8); and
 IV-Promote environmental education and grassroots involvement of children in Basin cleanup (Tasks 7, 8).
 LPBF s public facilities on New Orleans  lakefront, the New Canal Lighthouse and its associated Lakefront Learning Lab
 provide a wide array of appropriate education materials. It has also been the hub of grassroots participation in Basin
 cleanup, as well as learning venues for tens of thousands of teachers and students since it opened in April 2013 (Task 7).
 Outreach (Task 8) activities advance our programming, online resources, and advocacy. This task is coordinated by the
 Executive Director and implemented by our outreach coordinator and social media consultant. Methods include our
 monthly e-newsletter and other strategic messaging through traditional and social media, with tracking activity and
 reporting results.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 CMP Promoting Plan Implementation Need:
 I: Promote coordination among public and private entities whose actions affect or could affect the use, restoration,
 and/or preservation of the Pontchartrain Basin (Task 9).
 LPBF s Public Access efforts focus along the perimeter of the lake and adjacent waterways. LPBF staff functions as
 facilitator, liaison, and networker in fostering new public access opportunities along and near the lake. Staff also function
 as a watchdog regarding threats to continued access and/or degradation of accessible areas due to fly-dumping, etc.
 Leveraging partnerships for both the offensive and defensive activities described above is central to working with
 multiple parish officials, municipal leaders, business interests, and citizen advocates that help cultivate progress
 regarding use of the Basin.

In order to combat high water loss due to aging water lines, the City of Fleming-Neon is planning to replace and modernize their water system. When the original system was created, GIS mapping was not available and data and information as to locations, line size and material have been lost over the years, making it almost impossible to detect or prevent breaks. 
 
 Phase 1 will replace approximately 10,200 feet of 8"""" PVC and 4,400 feet of PVC waterlines from the water treatment plant on Shea Fork to the Neon city limits on Hwy 343 and Northeast along Hwy 343 to its intersection with Chopping Branch in the McRoberts area and any side roads. The project will address lines from the water treatment plant along Shea Fork to its end. The McRoberts area has been deemed the worst in the system. This phase will enhance the systems conversion to radio read meters by adding 149 new meters and provide flow-leak detectors in the system. Creek crossings will be directionally drilled to prevent biological disturbance. Trenchless/low-impact technology will be used when applicable.

The new vehicles must meet more stringent emissions standards. Utilizing federal EPA funds, matched with funding from New Hampshireâ  s Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust Fund, NHDES had $750,000 available for grants.  
 
 A request for proposal (RFP) was conducted from November 17, 2020 through January 19, 2021.  Nine entities applied for funding. Three proposals were approved for funding (see Attachment A for the scoring results), one of which was withdrawn. First Student requested partial funding to replace thirteen (13) engine model year 2006 to 2007 school buses. The 13 buses have an average age of just over 15 years, an average of 174,243 miles of operation and are listed as being in fair condition. They operate in a cold weather environment and are typically operated in a dual startup/shutdown mode (a morning run and an afternoon run) each operating day which increases wear and tear on the engine. School buses are also typically inactive for extended periods of time thus mileage is typically accrued over shorter operating times. The characteristics of the 13 school buses are shown in Figure 1.
  
 
 The DERA program has mandatory minimum cost share requirements for a vehicle replacement project of 75 percent. NHDES will provide a grant of the lesser of $289,468.00 or 25 percent of the total replacement cost (estimated $1,157,871.00) to First Student, Inc. for the replacement of 13 school buses.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00A00175_6800/,2021-07-23 08:20:19+00

At least 820 acres will be priority land with the remaining acres considered associate priority land.  The BMPS will reduce the annual delivery of sediment and phosphorus to Rathbun Lake by an estimated 3,775 tons and 5,085 pounds respectively.  In addition to the 54 targeted sub-watersheds in which this project is currently active, activities will also be expanded into the Lower Jackson Creek targeted sub-watershed encompassing 7,024 acres delivering an estimated 6,360 tones of sediment and 8,550 pounds of phosphorus each year to Rathbun Lake. Thirty-five landowners own and/or operate farms with priority land in the sub-watershed and at least 17 of these are highly likely to install BMPs.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00740427_6800/,2022-03-07 13:04:10+00

 Objectives
 
 The Sullivan County SWCD plans to improve water quality in the Maria & No Business Creek Watersheds by accomplishing four main objectives over the course of four years. 1) Develop a Watershed Management Plan 2) Develop and Implement an approved Cost-Share Program 3) Establish a water quality monitoring/assessment program 4) Increase Public Awareness and Stewardship Through Outreach and Education.
 
 Methods
  The WMP will serve as a compiled analysis of all baseline data, newly collected monitoring data, land use information, resource concerns, and stakeholder input. It will clearly outline all information necessary for the determination of critical areas within the watershed. Once critical areas are defined, they will begin to formulate long-term goals in order to systematically address water quality concerns through the implementation of BMPs and conservation efforts.
 Overview:
 The Grantee shall develop and promote a cost-share program to implement best management practices (BMPs) such as conservation tillage, exclusion fencing, hay/pasture land improvement and others that address the water quality concerns outlined in the Maria-No Business Creek Watershed Management Plan.
 
 Objectives:
 Develop and promote a cost-share program to implement best management practices, conduct a monitoring program to show general trends in water quality, and conduct an education and outreach program designed to bring about behavioral changes and encourage BMP implementation that will lead to reduced nonpoint source pollution in the watershed.  
 
 Methods:
 Implement best management practices, conduct a monitoring program following the guidelines of a QAPP, and conduct an education and outreach program by holding workshops/field days, steering committee meetings, distributing flyers/brochures and newsletters. Conducting community events, public meetings, press releases and Hoosier Riverwatch Training events.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_97548220_6800/,2021-04-19 14:22:16+00

Lake Erie sites in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan may also be samples by our group. 
 Our research team monitoring approximately 40 Great Lakes coastal wetlands per year between 2021 and 2025 as allocated annually according to the detailed study design of the project. The detailed methodology will follow the protocols recommended by the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Consortium (Burton et al. 2007) as amended and described in detail and implements in the Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP) implemented for the current 5-year GLRI0funded project in which we are currently participating, Coastal Wetland Monitoring: Continued Implementation by the GLCWC (â  CWM-2â  , Uzarski et al. 2015; Brady et al. 2019). 
 Each year (February-April), we will review the candidate list of proposed sampling sites to confirm that they meet sampling criteria (suitable size, connection to a Great Lake, habitat type, and accessibility). Field crews will also be trained, updated in revised protocols and tested for proficiency at this time. Birds and amphibians at each wetland will be assessed on 3 occasions in spring or early summer by the Bird Studies Canada team using Marsh Monitoring Program protocols (Uzarski et al. 2015). Sampling and monitoring for water quality, vegetation, aquatic invertebrates and fishes will be conducted at each wetland during single visits between June 1 and September 30 each year. Water quality will be assessed by using field meters and by collecting samples for determination of nutrient concentrations and routine parameters at an analytical laboratory. Composition of the plant community will be assessed by documenting the identify and areal coverage of species in quadrants assigned among various transects. Fishes will be live-trapped in Fyke nets set overnight, enumerated, identified to species, measures and released. Aquatic invertebrates will be collected using D-frame dip nets. Groups of 150 individuals will be hand-picked form samples collected in each of several vegetation zones, preserved in ethanol and later identified in the laboratory. Voucher specimens of all collections will be kept in reference collections and/or provided to regulating agencies as required by terms of reference of collection permits. Accuracy of data will be quality checked internally and by exchanging specimens with companion teams to cross-validate identifications. All QAâ  d data will then be entered into the Coastal Wetland Monitoring database. All research findings will be communicated in semi-annual reports submitted to EPA, in annual meetings of the PIs and at academic and other meetings that provide opportunities to describe our progress and interim results.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00E02956_6800/,2021-07-27 12:00:43+00

Replacement of Well 9 will require drilling a new well within 150 feet of the existing well in order to be considered a replacement well under the existing permit. The City would like this well to be re-drilled and equipped to fulfill the 2,419 AFY of water permitted for this well. The new well will be drilled in accordance with the hydrogeologistâ  s recommendations. 
 Furthermore, power availability will be analyzed and extended as necessary to mitigate power outages. Water from Well 9 is currently treated with a Hungerford and Terry coagulation-filtration arsenic treatment system constructed in October 2006. Water is also chlorinated with ferric and PH adjustment prior to entering the water distribution system. The requirements for treatment at Site 9 will be determined upon well production and water quality testing of the re- drilled (new) well. It is anticipated that arsenic treatment will be required based on other wells in the Cityâ  s water system. The existing arsenic treatment has a maximum capacity of 0.95-MGD; therefore, the system will likely 
 need to be expanded or replaced to meet the new well capacity. (See attached Planning Document with CPB Approval Letter). The City 
 recently purchased several acres of adjacent property, which has been environmentally cleared (See attached EID) for this project and is 
 already in design to construct a 3MG steel holding tank on site. The construction of this tank will begin in the Fall of 2020 and will be funded 
 entirely with City funds. The DWSRF Funds will be used to construct a new (replacement) well on site, install new pump and a new variable 
 frequency drive (VFD) motor system, install adequate arsenic treatment facilities, and build a new well house and security fencing. The estimated construction costs for this project is approximately $15M.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_99692522_6800/,2021-06-01 15:56:50+00

 2.Develop and Deliver Trainings - The WSU EFC will develop, coordinate and conduct in-person and/or virtual trainings on the following topic areas as requested by regulatory and funding agencies in each state. It is anticipated that WSU will provide 20 total trainings: one in each of the four (4) EPA Region 7 states (Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri) and sixteen (16) trainings in other locations outside Region 7 based on topic requests, audience needs and availability. Trainings may be virtual or in-person events. 
 In order to provide quality and relevant trainings with the most up-to-date resources, information and tools, WSU EFC staff will also participate in trainings, conferences, workshops and meetings to build additional internal knowledge and network capacity to ensure trainings, webinars, biogs, technical assistance, resource development, etc. meet the high standards the water utilities in our nation expect and deserve.
 3.Technical Assistance -The WSU EFC will provide technical assistance to twenty (20) systems. Technical assistance may be on-site, by phone, virtually or via e-mail to water systems in the locations and topic areas listed in Task #2. The length of the assistance to each individual drinking water system may vary depending on the needs of the system and the requests of the state or territory, but there is a general target of 10-15 hours of assistance provided per system.
 4.Develop and Deliver Durable Resources -Through engagement with state agency stakeholders, WSU EFC, SW EFC and EFCN will identify educational topic and format needs (virtual, onÂ demand, social media and durable resources). WSU EFC will develop, and participate in the development of, virtual education events (webinars, biogs, podcasts, recorded e-learning, etc.) and durable/ongoing resources (checklists, videos, white papers, social media communications, etc.) on topics listed in Task #2. Resources that are developed will be hosted on EFCN or SW EFC websites. 
 5.Tribal and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Focus -WSU EFC will make every effort to reach out to tribal utilities in each state where we provide trainings. WSU EFC staff work regularly with tribal utilities. WSU EFC will also review outreach and marketing plans for trainings and resources to ensure that the trainings and resources are equitably accessible to diverse and inclusive audiences.
 6.Coordinating Meetings -The WSU EFC will participate in coordinating meetings related to the Small Systems project. Most meetings will be virtual. However there will be at least one inÂ person meeting to kick-off this project. The Director, Tonya Bronleewe, and the Project Lead, currently, Nicholas Willis, will attend this meeting.
 7.Project Reporting -This project requires monthly verbal progress reports with the SW EFC as the lead applicant with the EPA Project Officer and quarterly written progress reports. WSU will provide information for progress reporting in an electronic EFCN database for each of these types of progress reports. In addition, WSU will participate in project conference calls as required by the SW EFC to ensure that the project activities are on track.

When systems falter, technical, financial and/or managerial deficiencies often exist, which are intensified for small systems due to a lack of economies of scale, inadequate staffing, retention and training, insufficient managerial capacity, insufficient revenues, lack of asset management and planning to manage capital costs, difficulty navigating external funding, and lack of understanding and meeting regulatory requirements.  
 To assist these small water systems, the Environmental Finance Center Network proposes to increase the technical, managerial and financial capacity of small water systems by delivering comprehensive training and technical assistance to help system operators, managers, and governing body members understand their roles and responsibilities and regulations, understand expenses, develop sound revenue generation measures, improve efficiency, manage assets at the lowest life-cycle cost, communicate with decision makers and ratepayers, and have appropriately-trained staff to ensure compliance.
 
 The broader teamâ  s proposal outputs include in-person workshops, webinars to either a national or state audience, technical assistance efforts, rates dashboards, and blog posts. Expected outcomes include systems with greater technical, financial and managerial capacity to provide safe drinking water and ensure compliance.

The Iowa Great Lakes are a major recreational destination for Iowa residents and visitors from adjacent states. Agricultural runoff containing sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and feedlot waste negatively affect water quality in the lakes.  Urbanization also contributes to pollution via storm water runoff, and there a number of private sewage disposal systems in the watershed area that are improperly installed or maintained. In 2010 the Iowa Great Lakes Watershed Management Plan was developed for the purpose of removing and preventing impairments in the watershed, guided by Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) documents developed for Lower and Upper Gar Lakes as well as Milford Creek which is the outlet for all of the Iowa Great Lakes chain.  This plan has been updated in 2013 and 2018 to reclassify subwatershed priority and other changes as needed.  Primary targeted watershed areas for this round of funding include East Okoboji Beach, Reeds Run, and Highway 71 subwatersheds. Other subwatersheds will implement BMPs through the project as opportunities arise, especially in conjunction with the Source Water Protection special project funded by EQIP.

A neighborhood organization promoted the use of the area as a park rather that a proposed landfill.  The lake is largely within the borers of Easter Lake Park managed by the Polk County Conservation Board with three other city parks within the 6,380 acre watershed.  The lake suffers from poor water clarity, algal blooms, high sedimentation rates, low oxygen concentrations, and a poor fishery.  Since construction, the water volume has decreased by nearly 30% as a result of sediment being deposited in the lake.  Watershed modeling has identified high sediment and phosphorus loads originating from predominately urban areas of the watershed and the Yeader Creek drainage area.  Phase 2 projects and programs are aimed at reducing external pollutant delivery to the lake through cost-share and financial incentives for watershed BMPs and two major stream stabilization projects. Watershed BMPs will focus on rainscaping practices such as rain gardens, bioswales, pervious pavement and more.  Decreasing the transport of eroded soil is critical to restoring Easter Lake and the watershed to a healthy, functioning system.  The goal of Phase 2 is a 25% reduction of sediment and 20% reduction of phosphorus loading.  This sub-award is for Year 9 of the watershed action plan targeting the reduction of sedimentation and phosphorus loading by 5%.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00740427_6800/,2021-05-18 15:32:37+00

The resulting report, 'Water Quality Matters to Us All', highlighted the challenges and collaborative effort needed to both understand water quality and work towards improvement of Iowa's waters.  A decade later, it is important to revisit the themes of that influential report and Iowa State University plans to conduct a statewide evaluation to highlight the new and changing voices in conservation and water quality in Iowa.
 Deliverables include:  survey of Iowans across many demographics; six listening sessions; evaluate nine watersheds with stream signs and two without (outreach effectiveness monitoring); video campus interviews at regents universities on watersheds and water quality; 20-25 video interviews of newer voices in conservations and environmental leadership in Iowa; production of the final 'Water Quality Matters to Us All: A Vision for the Future' report; all other federal- and state-required reporting outputs.

The line replacements will include the following: 6,300 LF of 8"" and 6"" PVC on Highway 80 North; 2,200 LF of 6"" PVC on Greensburg Street; 3,400 LF of 6"" PVC on West Stockton & Miller Streets; 3,500 LF of 6"" PVC on Highway 640; 1,500 LF of 8"" PVC on Highway 90 and 11,600 LF of 4"" PVC on  Lonestar Ridge Road. The existing control / pressure reducing station on Highway 3234 will be also replaced. 
 
 The project will also extend approximately 15,100 LF of new 3"" waterlines to create two (2) new loops to improve water quality and eliminate dead end waterlines. The new line construction will include: 7,100 LF of 3"" PVC on Peckerwood Ridge Road and 8,000 LF of 3"" PVC on Roy Grider Road.
 
 In addition to waterline replacements and extensions, this project will rehab, construct, and decommission water tanks and pump stations to improve water quality, pressure, and efficiency in the distribution system. One new water tank will be constructed, four (4) existing water tanks will be rehabilitated or modified, and one existing water tank will be decommissioned. Two existing pump stations will be replaced with upgraded pump stations, one pump station will be modified, and one pump station will be eliminated. SCADA will be upgraded or modified on all new, rehabilitated, or modified tanks and pump stations.
 
 The existing 200,000 gallon Edmonton tank and 100,000 gallon Gascon tank will be completely rehabilitated including miscellaneous structural repairs, new interior and exterior coatings, control valve vaults and piping modification. The existing turnover issues at the 100,000 Gallon Harvey Estes tank and 100,000 Gallon Hickory Ridge tank will be also addressed through piping modifications. The piping and control valve arraignments at all four (4) existing tanks will be modified such that the tanks will fill near the top and drain from the bottom of the bowl. This will greatly improve the turnover and reduce the production of disinfection byproducts. A new Summer Shade 250,000 gallon elevated storage tank will replace the existing 100,000 gallon structure to address inadequate storage and alleviate pressure issues in portions of the distribution system. 
 
 The existing Highway 90 booster pump station that fills the Summer Shade tank will be replaced with a new station, increasing the capacity from 120 GPM to approximately 225 GPM.  The existing Harvey Estes pump station, that fills the Gason and Hickory Ridge tanks will be also be replaced new station, increasing the capacity from 250 GPM to approximately 300 GPM. The existing Harvey Estes pump station will remain and be modified only for use in supplying fire service to an industrial user.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_98454720_6800/,2021-09-07 14:31:32+00

NHDES proposes to use the funds to assist a select list of small and disadvantaged water systems to provide funding assistance for improvements to their drinking water systems necessary to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), address water supply capacity issues or respond to a drinking water contaminant. 
 
 The Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau (DWGB) intends to use the grant funds to develop and implement a small/disadvantaged grant program for the neediest water systems in the State. Initially, two community water systems are identified as meeting eligibility requirements for the subawards. Additional eligible recipients will be identified as funding allows.  
 
 In conjunction with a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) loan Marlborough Estates will use the grant funds for water system improvements including source replacement, and pump house and water storage upgrades. The three existing bedrock wells have all significantly declined in their capacity to provide an adequate supply to the community.  This project will improve water quantity and quality issues as well as improve resiliency.
 
 The South Weare Water Association will use the grant funds for water system improvements including developing a new water supply well with associated infrastructure, controls, and water treatment needs. Additional improvements include water main replacement, meter installation, pump house upgrades and water storage improvements. The water system lacks the capacity to meet even average daily water demands, the community endures frequent and extended water outages, and water is not reliably available. This project will improve water quantity and quality issues as well as improve resiliency and reliability.
 
 In the event that grant funds no longer become available, General funds will not be requested to support this program. This agreement has been approved by the Attorney Generalâ  s Office as to form, substance and execution.

 These training and technical assistance modules will be delivered via a mixture of face-to-face remote learning modes. Face-to-face training modules will feature hands-on learning activities on asset management practices. Face-to-face training will be the preferred mode for communities with the CNY region and for multi-state regional technical assistance events under normal circumstances. These training sessions will feature classroom training, workshops, and site visits. Remote learning modes will be used when conditions due to COVID-19 or budgetary concerns make face-to-face training impossible or infeasible. Remote learning modes will feature video conferences, online courses, and webcasts. Syracuse team will take advantage of Syracuse University Environmental Finance Centerâ  s network in identifying communities of highest need and in tailoring training material to address any specific needs of these communities. Training modules will also be customized for needs of different stakeholders (e.g., managers, operators, maintenance personnel). Specifically, the SU-EFC will provide the following:
 â ¢3 In-Person Trainings
 â ¢2 Virtual Trainings
 â ¢3 Technical Assistances (Tas)
 â ¢3 Blog posts
 â ¢3 Podcasts
 â ¢1 Educational Videos
 â ¢1 Peer-to-peer Learning Sessions
 â ¢Travel to Round 9 Retreat
 Additionally, the SU-EFC will manage all projects logistics, internal and external communications and marketing, and will work with the Southwest EFC to engage with state agency contacts and EPA Regional contact.
 
 All activities will be undertaken in close collaboration with the full project team. The anticipated output of Syracuse teamâ  s effort is an increased number of stakeholders receiving training on asset management of small publicly-owned wastewater systems and onsite/decentralized wastewater systems. The anticipated outcome of Syracuse teamâ  s efforts is wider adoption of asset management programs within stakeholders who manage onsite/decentralized wastewater systems and small public-owned wastewater systems.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84025501_6800/,2021-10-29 13:59:19+00

Recent epidemiological studies showed that Ethylene Oxide is a more potent carcinogen than previously documented, resulting in an update to the inhalation risk estimate for Ethylene Oxide. This resulted in the identification of Ethylene Oxide as a potential health concern in several areas across the United States, including in the state of Utah. Modeling results from the 2014 National Air Toxics Assessment indicate an increased potential cancer risk from Ethylene Oxide for several census tracks across the United States due to emissions from 26 facilities, including two in Utah. The first is a medical sterilization facility located in close proximity of the Salt Lake City International Airport. The other is a medical device manufacturing plant located in Sandy, Utah who uses Ethylene Oxide to sterilize the medical equipment it manufactures. To characterize ambient emission of Ethylene Oxide from the facilities and assess their health impact on surrounding communities, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality is proposing to conduct ambient monitoring in the vicinity of the two facilities. 24-hour canister measurements will be collected at multiple sampling sites, located near and at different distances from the sterilization facilities. Measured ambient data will then be used in a health risk assessment analysis to identify cancer and non-cancer risks associated with the exposure to Ethylene Oxide from these facilities.","66.034: SURVEYS, STUDIES, RESEARCH, INVESTIGATIONS, DEMONSTRATIONS, AND SPECIAL PURPOSE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT",sub-grant,0f72fabe16d6b6a3d656c16aee930e14,2021,5,22-0517,141338.00,2021-05-01,2021,LL8GLEVH6MG3,009095365,"UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, THE",,LL8GLEVH6MG3,009095365,"UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, THE",USA,UNITED STATES,201 PRESIDENTS CIR,SALT LAKE CITY,UT,Utah,841129049,02,,"U.S. State Government,Educational Institution,State Controlled Institution of Higher Learning",,Salt Lake City,UT,Utah,841129049,02,USA,UNITED STATES,"A subaward with the University of Utah and Prof. Handy for conducting the health risk assessment analysis component of the research project, which is one of expected deliverables",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_96861401_6800/,2021-08-31 15:36:39+00

The line replacements will include the following: 6,300 LF of 8"" and 6"" PVC on Highway 80 North; 2,200 LF of 6"" PVC on Greensburg Street; 3,400 LF of 6"" PVC on West Stockton & Miller Streets; 3,500 LF of 6"" PVC on Highway 640; 1,500 LF of 8"" PVC on Highway 90 and 11,600 LF of 4"" PVC on  Lonestar Ridge Road. The existing control / pressure reducing station on Highway 3234 will be also replaced. 
 
 The project will also extend approximately 15,100 LF of new 3"" waterlines to create two (2) new loops to improve water quality and eliminate dead end waterlines. The new line construction will include: 7,100 LF of 3"" PVC on Peckerwood Ridge Road and 8,000 LF of 3"" PVC on Roy Grider Road.
 
 In addition to waterline replacements and extensions, this project will rehab, construct, and decommission water tanks and pump stations to improve water quality, pressure, and efficiency in the distribution system. One new water tank will be constructed, four (4) existing water tanks will be rehabilitated or modified, and one existing water tank will be decommissioned. Two existing pump stations will be replaced with upgraded pump stations, one pump station will be modified, and one pump station will be eliminated. SCADA will be upgraded or modified on all new, rehabilitated, or modified tanks and pump stations.
 
 The existing 200,000 gallon Edmonton tank and 100,000 gallon Gascon tank will be completely rehabilitated including miscellaneous structural repairs, new interior and exterior coatings, control valve vaults and piping modification. The existing turnover issues at the 100,000 Gallon Harvey Estes tank and 100,000 Gallon Hickory Ridge tank will be also addressed through piping modifications. The piping and control valve arraignments at all four (4) existing tanks will be modified such that the tanks will fill near the top and drain from the bottom of the bowl. This will greatly improve the turnover and reduce the production of disinfection byproducts. A new Summer Shade 250,000 gallon elevated storage tank will replace the existing 100,000 gallon structure to address inadequate storage and alleviate pressure issues in portions of the distribution system. 
 
 The existing Highway 90 booster pump station that fills the Summer Shade tank will be replaced with a new station, increasing the capacity from 120 GPM to approximately 225 GPM.  The existing Harvey Estes pump station, that fills the Gason and Hickory Ridge tanks will be also be replaced new station, increasing the capacity from 250 GPM to approximately 300 GPM.

 aquatic species and I have been using zebrafish as a model species in my research for the
 past 12 years. I am currently funded through the Canadaâ  s Natural Sciences and Engineering
 Research council on three major awards that focus on novel cytochrome P450 enzymes in
 fish and aquatic annelids (Discovery grant), the impacts of temperature on fish development
 (Collaborative Research and Development grant) and fetal programming of low dose radiation
 (Collaborative Research and Development grant); I have additional funding through the
 Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canadaâ  s National Contaminants Advisory Group on the
 impacts of temperature on metal toxicity in Arctic fish species.
 My research expertise is in the area of aquatic toxicology and cytochrome P450 (CYP)
 enzymes. For the past 12 years, we have undertaken a number of studies on the effects of
 human drugs on fish. These studies have examined developmental, reproductive and
 physiological effects of human drugs and zebrafish have been the central species of study.
 Our fundamental work on cytochrome P450 enzymes has provided a major foundation and
 tools for the proposed research. We have expressed zebrafish CYP1 and CYP3 enzymes in
 bacterial systems and developed a high throughput screening approach to determine
 substrates of these enzymes. This expertise in heterologous expression and high throughput
 screening with CYP enzymes will be deployed in this grant to assess metabolism of
 contaminants from the EPAâ  s tox cast libraries. This collaboration will provide an excellent
 opportunity to study xenobiotic metabolism of environmental contaminants of concern, an
 area that is synergistic with our toxicological studies in zebrafish. One of the impacts of our
 proposed studies will include providing data that is essential for toxicokinetics in
 environmental studies on contaminants.
 My research on CYPs has involved genomic, computational and functional studies aimed to
 understand the evolution and function of this important gene superfamily. My laboratory
 primarily focuses on aquatic species. In genomic and computation studies, we have

 completed genome annotations either at the CYP family level (e.g. CYP2 and CYP4 family
 evolutionary studies) or at the species level to understand the CYP complement. Most
 recently, we have annotated and performed phylogenetic analyses of the CYPome from an
 aquatic annelid, Capitella telata. Our work has most recently focused on annotating the round
 goby and Cnidarian (hydra, moon jelly, coral) genomes.
 In functional CYP studies, we have developed a high throughput screening (HTS) approach to
 determine CYP function using expressed proteins. My lab has successfully expressed all five
 zebrafish CYP1s, CYP3A65, and CYP3C1 proteins in bacteria. The expression system we
 use is robust and we are continuing to expand the number of CYPs that we express from
 zebrafish for functional studies. We are happy to bring our expertise to your project to
 express and characterize CYP mediated metabolism for this proposal; note that only one
 enzyme will be de novo expressed in this project as we have previously expressed the
 majority needed for this research. Our high throughput screening approach has been carefully
 developed using the zebrafish CYP1A protein. Our existing screening data used a chemical
 library that contains natural products and pharmaceutical compounds; we are pleased to
 utilize a chemical library of contaminants for your proposed studies and expand our
 toxicokinetic data to contaminants of concern. My lab is ideally suited to collaborate on this as
 we have the most extensive empirical data on zebrafish CYP1A metabolism available.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84002901_6800/,2022-02-28 13:48:23+00

The model will be based on Wu et al.2017 but incorporate traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) at certain locations where the
 biophysical data are not available or have large uncertainties. The integration will be facilitated
 by developing a BBN to record the TEK. The BBN belongs to a class of graphical models, which allow an intuitive representations of the probabilistic structure of multivariate data using directed
 acyclic graphs with nodes treated as continuous or discrete random variables (Schmitt and Brugere 2013, Scutari and Denis 2015). Nodes are connected in parent-child (predictive)relationships, represented by arrows. Except for decision and utility nodes, a child node (where
 the arrows are pointed to) has a conditional probability distribution (CPD) given the parent nodes (where the arrows are pointed from). The CPD will be derived based on the TEK (expert options). The node information will be updated into the posterior distributions using Bayes' rules of joint probabilities. The resulting BBN will include all the factors which the knowledgeable indigenous people think are important for coastal wetland vulnerability, such as water levels,temperature, and existence of oil pipelines etc. The integrated model will be utilized to evaluate short- (5 years) and long-term (multi-decades) coastal wetland change under different scenarios,including relative sea-level rise scenarios and restoration scenarios. This will not only facilitate the selection of restoration projects that will be best implemented during the duration of the proposed project, but also enhance the development of the T-CRI.

Potential coolwater streams will be identified by using the temperature tipping points for coolwater taxa and modeled stream temperature data. Stream temperature models and tools used to identify coolwater streams will be validated by deploying temperature loggers and collecting biological assemblages at sites around the State. Following data collection, new biotic indices will be modified to accurately evaluate biological assemblage expectations for coolwater streams. To enhance this project and conduct aquatic life use assessments, IDEM is proposing to use FFY20 Monitoring Initiative Funds to analyze water samples collected at coolwater sites in 2021. IDEM is requesting $61,494 for the analysis of general chemistry, dissolved metals, and nutrients at an IDEM contract lab. The project will enhance Indianaâ  s monitoring strategy by providing chemical data with biological assemblage information on coolwater streams to appropriately revise biological indices. The data will also be used to assess aquatic life use in IDEMâ  s Integrated Report, thus satisfying 305(b) and 303(d) reporting requirements to U.S. EPA. The purpose of this project is to analyze water samples for general chemistry, dissolved metals, and nutrients at an IDEM contract lab for sites sampled in 2021 throughout the State of Indiana for developing Coolwater IBI metrics for biological assemblages. Site locations have yet to be determined; however, there are potentially 45 total sites.

The ten proposals received were ranked based on the criteria included in the RFP: water quality improvement or protection; cost/benefit ratio; local capacity to complete the project; relative value or significance of the water body; and general quality and thoroughness of the proposal. Based on the results of the selection process and available federal grant funding levels, eight implementation projects were selected to receive funding. Please see Attachment B for a list of project rankings and NHDES review team members.
 
 Watershed Assistance Grants focus on the reduction of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. NPS pollution occurs when rainfall, snowmelt, or irrigation waters travel through the ground or across land, transporting materials that are then introduced into groundwater or deposited into rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. Pollutants can include chemicals, sediments, nutrients, and toxins that often have harmful effects on drinking water supplies, recreation, fisheries, and wildlife. Land development or changes in land use can also cause NPS pollution by disrupting the natural hydrology of a water body, increasing impervious surfaces, and contributing to the loss of aquatic habitat. Watershed Assistance Grants address NPS pollution by promoting responsible land use practices on the watershed scale.
 
 Chapel Brook is an impaired water body in North Hampton, NH that has experienced extensive flooding and neighborhood isolation during severe storm events. This project will retrofit the existing culvert at the outlet of Chapel Brook under Route 1A to the Atlantic Ocean, which will improve drainage and tidal flushing in and out of the marsh without increasing flood risk. Increased tidal flows will allow the stagnant and near-permanently flooded salt marsh of Philbrick Pond to drain and replenish according to natural tide cycles, which it is currently unable to do. In addition, the project partners will work to develop a salt marsh restoration design for Philbrick Pond and implement an initial design phase. This restoration design will identify techniques and strategies to correct the long-term impacts of tidal regime modification, past agricultural uses and mosquito control practices that continue to degrade the health of the marsh and its water quality.
 
 The total project costs are budgeted at $114,189. NHDES will provide $68,500 (60%) of the project costs through a federal grant, and The Nature Conservancy will provide the remaining costs through cash and in-kind services. A budget is provided in Attachment A. 
 
 In the event that federal funds become no longer available, general funds will not be requested to support this program.

The five proposals received were ranked based on the criteria included in the RFP: water quality improvement or protection; cost/benefit ratio; local capacity to complete the project; relative value or significance of the water body; and general quality and thoroughness of the proposal. Based on the results of the selection process and available federal grant funding levels, five implementation projects were selected to receive funding. Please see Attachment B for a list of project rankings and NHDES review team members.
 
 Watershed Assistance Grants focus on the reduction of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. NPS pollution occurs when rainfall, snowmelt, or irrigation waters travel through the ground or across land, transporting materials that are then introduced into groundwater or deposited into rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. Pollutants can include chemicals, sediments, nutrients, and toxins that often have harmful effects on drinking water supplies, recreation, fisheries, and wildlife. Land development or changes in land use can also cause NPS pollution by disrupting the natural hydrology of a water body, increasing impervious surfaces, and contributing to the loss of aquatic habitat. Watershed Assistance Grants address NPS pollution by promoting responsible land use practices on the watershed scale.
 
 Lake Warren is currently listed on the NHDES List of Impaired Waters as not supporting its designated use of Aquatic Life Integrity due to excessive concentrations of phosphorus and Chlorophyll-a. In the Lake Warren Watershed Management Plan (WMP), it was determined that a 28 percent reduction in phosphorus loading to Lake Warren was needed to restore water quality. This project will reduce pollutants through implementation of best management practices (BMPs) at select sites that have been identified in the WMP as being medium or high impact and by conducting outreach events to provide information to residents and interested parties on ways in which they can make changes to care for the lake and take steps that will help to improve water quality. The selected sites include stormwater management improvements to Arbor Way, a heavily eroded private drive along Pine Cliff Road, conceptual design for improvements to Pine Cliff Road reducing the road width to create a larger buffer and walkway between the edge of the road and the shoreline, technical assistance and installation of BMPS at residential, shoreland properties or town properties/right of ways.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_98132419_6800/,2021-07-01 11:21:29+00

 aquatic species and I have been using zebrafish as a model species in my research for the
 past 12 years. I am currently funded through the Canadaâ  s Natural Sciences and Engineering
 Research council on three major awards that focus on novel cytochrome P450 enzymes in
 fish and aquatic annelids (Discovery grant), the impacts of temperature on fish development
 (Collaborative Research and Development grant) and fetal programming of low dose radiation
 (Collaborative Research and Development grant); I have additional funding through the
 Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canadaâ  s National Contaminants Advisory Group on the
 impacts of temperature on metal toxicity in Arctic fish species.
 My research expertise is in the area of aquatic toxicology and cytochrome P450 (CYP)
 enzymes. For the past 12 years, we have undertaken a number of studies on the effects of
 human drugs on fish. These studies have examined developmental, reproductive and
 physiological effects of human drugs and zebrafish have been the central species of study.
 Our fundamental work on cytochrome P450 enzymes has provided a major foundation and
 tools for the proposed research. We have expressed zebrafish CYP1 and CYP3 enzymes in
 bacterial systems and developed a high throughput screening approach to determine
 substrates of these enzymes. This expertise in heterologous expression and high throughput
 screening with CYP enzymes will be deployed in this grant to assess metabolism of
 contaminants from the EPAâ  s tox cast libraries. This collaboration will provide an excellent
 opportunity to study xenobiotic metabolism of environmental contaminants of concern, an
 area that is synergistic with our toxicological studies in zebrafish. One of the impacts of our
 proposed studies will include providing data that is essential for toxicokinetics in
 environmental studies on contaminants.
 My research on CYPs has involved genomic, computational and functional studies aimed to
 understand the evolution and function of this important gene superfamily. My laboratory
 primarily focuses on aquatic species. In genomic and computation studies, we have

 completed genome annotations either at the CYP family level (e.g. CYP2 and CYP4 family
 evolutionary studies) or at the species level to understand the CYP complement. Most
 recently, we have annotated and performed phylogenetic analyses of the CYPome from an
 aquatic annelid, Capitella telata. Our work has most recently focused on annotating the round
 goby and Cnidarian (hydra, moon jelly, coral) genomes.
 In functional CYP studies, we have developed a high throughput screening (HTS) approach to
 determine CYP function using expressed proteins. My lab has successfully expressed all five
 zebrafish CYP1s, CYP3A65, and CYP3C1 proteins in bacteria. The expression system we
 use is robust and we are continuing to expand the number of CYPs that we express from
 zebrafish for functional studies. We are happy to bring our expertise to your project to
 express and characterize CYP mediated metabolism for this proposal; note that only one
 enzyme will be de novo expressed in this project as we have previously expressed the
 majority needed for this research. Our high throughput screening approach has been carefully
 developed using the zebrafish CYP1A protein. Our existing screening data used a chemical
 library that contains natural products and pharmaceutical compounds; we are pleased to
 utilize a chemical library of contaminants for your proposed studies and expand our
 toxicokinetic data to contaminants of concern. My lab is ideally suited to collaborate on this as
 we have the most extensive empirical data on zebrafish CYP1A metabolism available.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84002901_6800/,2021-01-29 15:20:12+00

NHDES proposes to use the funds to assist a select list of small and disadvantaged water systems to provide funding assistance for improvements to their drinking water systems necessary to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), address water supply capacity issues or respond to a drinking water contaminant. 
 
 The Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau (DWGB) intends to use the grant funds to develop and implement a small/disadvantaged grant program for the neediest water systems in the State. Initially, two community water systems are identified as meeting eligibility requirements for the subawards. Additional eligible recipients will be identified as funding allows.  
 
 In conjunction with a Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) loan Marlborough Estates will use the grant funds for water system improvements including source replacement, and pump house and water storage upgrades. The three existing bedrock wells have all significantly declined in their capacity to provide an adequate supply to the community.  This project will improve water quantity and quality issues as well as improve resiliency.
 
 The South Weare Water Association will use the grant funds for water system improvements including developing a new water supply well with associated infrastructure, controls, and water treatment needs. Additional improvements include water main replacement, meter installation, pump house upgrades and water storage improvements. The water system lacks the capacity to meet even average daily water demands, the community endures frequent and extended water outages, and water is not reliably available. This project will improve water quantity and quality issues as well as improve resiliency and reliability.
 
 In the event that grant funds no longer become available, General funds will not be requested to support this program. This agreement has been approved by the Attorney Generalâ  s Office as to form, substance and execution.

The distribution system improvements will reduce water loss, maintain adequate elevated storage capacity and system pressure for the current population, and add ground storage tank redundancy to allow for flexibility in operations and maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_01F89901_6800/,2021-09-24 15:25:18+00

It has been long known that the 8180 of atmospheric 02 is about-25%0  higher than oceanic water.   More recently this was recognized as the global net consequence of   respiration strongly discriminating against 1 8 0 leaving the atmosphere relatively enriched in 1 8 0 . Photosynthetic 02 is produced by splitting of H20 and has a similar 81 8  0  to environmental  water (-0%0 in the case of seawater).    Hence, net biological 02 production  produces severe 1 8     0
 depletion in dissolved 02. 81 8  0 2 primarily responds to 1) photosynthetic 02 production which
 lowers 81 8  0 2 and 2) respiration which increases 01 8  0 2. The respiration effect in turn is modulated by the proportions of water column and benthic respiration. Increasing importance of benthic respiration attenuates the relationship between 81 8  0 2 and net 02 consumption. As for denitrification, benthic  respiration  produces  little  isotopic fractionation.
 Analysis for 81 8  0 2 is complemented  by measurement of Oi/Ar ratio as the latter is only influenced by net biological production or removal. 02 concentration per se is also affected by physical influences particularly temperature and salinity forced changes in solubility. In our prior LIS work, we saw large summertime variations in 0180 2 coupled to Oi/Ar which is measured simultaneously. Toward the west and at the surface, high Oi/Ar (excess 02) correlated with low 81 8  0 2 as expected from high biological productivity. We will exploit this signal to trace the transfer of photosynthetic 02 via mixing to the subsurface zone. In the bottom  layer, the  relationship between increasing 8180 2 and decreasing excess 02 suggests an overall even partitioning  between benthic and water  column  respiration.
 As part of this project, we will carry out for 81 8  0  2 and 02/Ar. analyses on samples collected from the LIS water column during its research cruises. Our goal here with the other PI's is to geochemically constrain the summertime LIS 02 budget to better understand the conditions that give rise to hypoxia and how they are varying from year to year with reductions in N loading.
 We will directly examine the quantitative contribution of photosynthetic 02 to the hypoxic zone and the relative importance of water column and benthic respiration using 81 8  0  2 and Oi/Ar as tracers for these processes as discussed above.  High precision measurements of 81 8  0 2 and Oi/Ar will be made on septum sealed serum bottles using an automated, on-line gas extraction system coupled to a multicollector IRMS as described in Charoenpong et al. (2014). 01 8  0 2 is determined relative to atmospheric 02 and corrected for ion source effects of varying 02/N2. Excess 02 concentration in ÂµM, the observed [02] minus the equilibrium [02] at in-situ temperature and  salinity as determined from 02/Ar, will be calculated as in Charoenpong et al. (2014). Excess 02 and 81 8  0 2 will be calibrated daily against seawater standards equilibrated with air at fixed temperature. Precision of the measurements (standard deviation) for the samples is generally better than 1 Âµmol L-1 for [02]excess and 0.2%0 for 01 8  0 2.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00A00284_6800/,2021-07-16 15:59:37+00

 The NADO Research Foundation (NADO RF) will support the project team by promoting upcoming events and webinars, services, and other resources and distributing information and updates to the NADO membership and its partners. NADO RF is the research arm of the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), a national membership association of regional development organizations (RDOs) that serve primarily smaller metropolitan and rural regions. These entities work to improve local and regional quality of life by promoting economic and community development through place-based strategies in the areas of housing, transportation, infrastructure, workforce development, entrepreneurship, disaster resilience, aging services, and other sectors. 
 NADO RF staff will carry out this task by sharing information and updates through its weekly newsletter NADO News (readership 1,500), the NADO website, social media channels, and eÂ mail blasts to the membership, as well as targeted outreach to members and their partners who may benefit from the services offered by the project team. 
 Task 2: Plan, Promote, and Deliver Two Webinars
 NADO RF staff will organize two webinars during the project that will feature how regional development organizations are supporting small water systems projects in their regions and highlight best practices and case studies. These webinars will follow a similar model to the webinars delivered in previous rounds, ""RDOs: Supporting Water Infrastructure and Improving Quality of Life"" (November 15, 2018), ""Connecting the Dots: Regional Development Organizations and Water Systems"" (May 16, 2019), and ""Leveraging Regional Development Organizations to Support Small Water Systems"" (January 26, 2021). 
 Task 3: Plan and Write Two Blog Posts 
 NADO RF staff will write two blog posts that will highlight case studies and best practices of how regional development organizations are partnering with local communities to support small water systems projects.
 Task 4: Participate on Project Team Conference Calls and Other Team-Building Events 
 NADO RF staff will participate on weekly planning calls with the project team, as well as other team-building activities. Staff will maintain consistent communication with project partners to develop and improve outreach, marketing, and event planning. 
 Task 5: Facilitate Opportunities for In-Person Events and Workshops 
 NADO RF staff will collaborate with the project team to identify and pursue opportunities for the project team to conduct in-person workshops and other trainings. These may include events at established NADO conferences such as the Annual Training Conference and other regional convenings, at other partner events, and/or on-site in RDO regions.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_84025401_6800/,2021-10-29 16:00:52+00

Robinson Pond is home to the town swimming beach, boat launch, and picnic area. It is an important and popular natural resource for the residents of Hudson, NH. An extensive trail system and wildlife sanctuary exist adjacent to the pond. Despite the best efforts of the conservationists, active volunteer water quality monitors, and a citizens group working on behalf of the pondÂ¿s health, historic trend analysis indicates the pond is affected by consistently high and worsening levels of nutrient pollution which contributes to conditions that promote algal and cyanobacteria levels that exceed water quality thresholds. This plan will specifically address these issues in a holistic, watershed-level manner. Specifically, the plan will estimate pollutant loads from various sources, particularly phosphorus, and make recommendations on management actions to reduce loading, and lay out an action plan for success. Ultimately, the goal is to help reach the PondÂ¿s potential for restoration and sustained protection into the future.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_00100221_6800/,2022-01-19 11:31:06+00

 Project 1 - Disinfection By-Product Reduction with a Greensand Filtration System. The Greensand Filtration System is necessary to remove high iron and total organic carbon (TOC) levels in a new constructed Well (#3R) and other two Wells on site.  TOC levels are higher than 2 mg/L, which will result on high disinfection by-products formation. Also, iron level is exceeding the SDWA Secondary regulatory limit (0.3 mg/L).
 Project 2 â   Pipe Rehabilitation and Looping Projects. This project will replace hydraulically dysfunctional water mains. These hydraulically defective water mains are still causing two sampling points TTTHMs excedances for the regulatory levels under Stage 2 DBPs Rule.  Galvanize, corroded ductile iron, and new water mains not connected to existing services are causing high water loss, high water age, and unwanted bottlenecks within the water distribution system.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_98452220_6800/,2022-02-07 15:21:41+00

 characteristics as a result of technological and societal changes. We will quantify
 the future implications of technologies and efficiency improvements in the energy
 and transportation sectors on regional differences in air pollution impacts. As a
 case study, we will assess the environmental and health benefits of choices in
 state and regional carbon policy implementation relevant to recently proposed
 carbon dioxide emission reductions from the energy sector. We will examine the
 health related benefits of reducing concentrations of ozone and particulate matter,
 as well as changing regional air pollution mixtures including air toxics.Approach: We will use an integrated assessment model framework linking
 economic models with details on advanced technologies for transportation and
 energy supply that consistently simulations economic and population growth, air
 quality, and health impacts, including the economic implications of air pollution
 health impacts. We will use matrices developed using air pollution sensitivities to
 source and region-based emissions from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport
 model to create a computationally-efficient integrated framework, which we will use
 to conduct quantitative uncertainty analysis of modifiable and other factors and
 their influence on future regional-scale air quality and its health and economic
 impacts. We will analyze case of future technology scenarios for carbon reduction
 strategies in the energy and transportation sector using economic model
 simulations, and examine the influence of global change scenarios by driving our
 integrated assessment framework with future meteorology.
 Expected results: This project will result in a computationally-efficient analysis tool
 that can be used to assess the relative importance of global change, technologies,
 and policies to air quality, including their costs and benefits, and taking into
 account uncertainties. We will identify the factors and modifiable strategies with
 most influence on air pollution health impacts, quantifying associated uncertainty
 ranges. The approach allows for a consistent estimates of the costs and cobenefits of regional carbon reduction strategies in combination with other air
 pollution reduction initiatives, including controls on air toxics.
 Personnel: Prof. Noelle Selin will coordinate integrated assessment modeling at
 MIT. Her research group developed the MIT Integrated Economy-Air QualityHealth Assessment framework. Prof. Barrett will lead modeling work using the
 GEOS-Chem XPLEX (which was developed in his group) and adjoint applications
 to health assessment, working closely with other PIs as this modeling is integrated
 within the larger framework. Prof. Susan Solomon will contribute to air quality
 analysis, in particular focusing on identifying sensitivity of PM changes to
 emissions changes. Dr. John Reilly will contribute expertise on economics and
 coordinate work on USREP-Reeds. Dr. Erwan Monier, whose research focuses on
 climate change and its impacts, will contribute as a research scientist to efforts
 using the IGSM-CAM. A postdoctoral associate working with Profs. Selin and
 Solomon will conduct integrated assessment work. A postdoctoral associate cosupervised by Dr. Reilly and Prof. Selin will assist with economic modeling and
 analysis. A graduate student co-supervised by Profs. Selin, Barrett and Solomon
 will run GEOS-Chem.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_83587201_6800/,2021-01-15 14:49:34+00

 The Southwest EFC will work with the Wichita State EFC to assist states in revising their capacity development strategies in order to incorporate asset management, which is mandated by America's Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA) of 2018. Specifically, the SW EFC will assist with the following: 
  Assisting in the identification of beneficial products that would assist states in updating their strategies. These products may include checklists, key questions, or other tools to inform state efforts.
  Participating in Workgroup for Creating Guidance Worksheet for Revising Capacity Development Strategies to Include Asset Management (The Workgroup). Review and revise the worksheet originally published as part of the Guidance on Implementing the Capacity Development Provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 as part of this Workgroup.
  Serving as a resource to assist states in updating their strategies, including sharing best practices among states and connecting peer states who are experiencing similar challenges.    Providing updates to EPA on key questions being asked by states and state support needs, including the need for additional tools or resources that may be helpful as states work toward their 2021 deadline for strategy updates.
  Increasing awareness among state capacity development programs of the resources EPA has developed to assist in their strategy-update efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_97756601_6800/,2020-12-02 14:35:44+00

 This document provides an overview of the background and circumstances which have led to a proposal by the Florida
 Governmental Utility Authority (FGUA) and Flagler County (the â  Countyâ  ) to pursue a transfer of the County water and
 wastewater utility system consisting of the Plantation Bay, Beverly Beach, and Eagle Lakes subsystems (collectively, the
 â  Flagler Utility Systemâ   or â  Utility Systemâ  ) to the FGUA.
 The Flagler Utility System is facing difficult issues associated with aging infrastructure, regulatory violations, mounting
 debt, and potentially significant rate increases for utility customers. The FGUA, in cooperation with the County, has
 outlined a plan to transfer the systems, achieve regulatory compliance, complete needed capital improvements, and
 significantly reduce rate impacts on customers. The Utility System has also been struggling with operational challenges,
 such as marginal water quality and lack of experienced utility staff. Implementation of daily operational improvements
 and system stability has already begun with the FGUA assuming management and operational responsibilities on behalf
 of the County in February 2020.
 The outlined FGUA plan includes:
 a) the use of existing utility cash balances to complete a series of critical capital improvements to both the water and
 wastewater systems, as well as to fund various costs associated with the transaction; and
 b) the use of new SRF loan proceeds to support the retirement of the existing County utility debt of $16,365,356, and
 therefore facilitate the transfer of the Utility System to the FGUA.
 The referenced capital improvements will address much of the aging infrastructure and regulatory violations, and the
 proposed SRF loans will provide critical improvements to cash flow by replacing the higher interest rate debt currently
 held by the County. The improved system cash flow will help alleviate the need for the large rate increases on the utility
 customers that would have been necessary under the Countyâ  s previous plan.
 In summary, the SRF loans are a necessary element to implement the plan to transfer the Flagler Utility System to the
 FGUA. The benefits of implementing the plan to transfer the system to the FGUA include:
 â ¢ Ownership by a public entity with a singular focus on water and wastewater utilities.
 â ¢ Seasoned utility management and operational expertise.
 â ¢ Proven capabilities to carry out needed capital improvements.
 â ¢ New capital plan will significantly improve aging infrastructure.
 â ¢ Regulatory violations to be cured by new capital plan.
 â ¢ New capital plan will also address capital needs not previously contemplated.
 â ¢ Significant reduction in financial stress on the utility and reduced rate pressure on the customers.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_98452220_6800/,2022-03-21 09:30:02+00

The new engines must meet more stringent emissions standards. Utilizing federal EPA funds, matched with funding from New Hampshireâ  s Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust Fund, NHDES has approximately $500,000 available for grants under this Request for Proposals.  
 
 A request for proposals was conducted from February 8 through March 8, 2021.  Seven entities applied for funding (see Attachment A for the scoring results). Eversource Energy requested partial funding to replace eight (8) 2009 model year International Navistar 4400 SBA trucks. (See Attachment B for a list of vehicles)
 
 Eversource Energyâ  s existing bucket trucks operate an average of 12,369 miles per year, however they idle 6-8 hours per day to power the aerials, increasing the emissions in highly-populated and economically disadvantaged communities.  Additionally, these vehicles have an average existing mileage of about 152,000 miles with the highest mileage truck having almost 184,000 miles.  This project will replace the vehicles with diesel bucket trucks equipped with battery-powered aerials that will eliminate the majority of the idling time.
 
 The DERA program has a mandatory minimum cost share requirement for a vehicle replacement project of 25 percent. NHDES will provide a grant of $387,190 or 25 percent, whichever is less, of the total replacement cost (estimated at $2,326,939) to Eversource Energy for the replacement of eight (8) utility trucks.
